        <h1>Test Project</h1>
        <p>This is a simple test project to demonstrate how easy it is to set up a new project.
            In this exercise, we completed the following tasks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set up the project folder and installed the initial packages</li>
            <li>Initialized Git</li>
            <li>Initialized Firebase</li>
            <li>Added some HTML code</li>
            <li>Linked the Bootstrap files</li>
            <li>Served and tested the project locally</li>
            <li>Packaged the project for deployment</li>
            <li>Deployed to Firebase</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Later, I might decide to come back here and play around with this file some more, to test out some things.
            It's sort of like a code sandbox that I can use to practice Bootstrap components, styles, and more.
            If I want to change anything in this project, I just need to re-build and re-deploy my changes. It's that
            easy!</p>
